# A-record-ip-address-checker
A bash script that checks the IP address that an A record points to, every 15 seconds.

I created this script when changing my personal wbsites to be hosted on GitHub Pages. The A records were taking a while to propogate with a custom domain so I wrote this script the check propogation, so I didn't have to.
